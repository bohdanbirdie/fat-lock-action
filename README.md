A GitHub Action that monitors the size of lock file changes in pull requests. It
helps prevent accidental lock file regeneration and ensures that dependency
changes are intentional. üîê

## Features

- Monitors changes in package lock files (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`,
  etc.)
- Comments on PRs when lock file changes exceed a specified threshold
- Can fail CI checks if changes are too large
- Configurable thresholds and file paths
- Supports multiple lock file formats

## Usage

Add this action to your workflow:

```yaml
name: Check Lock File Changes

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  check-lock:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: bohdanbirdie/fat-lock-action@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          size-threshold: 1000
          lock-file-path: 'package-lock.json'
          comment-enabled: true
          fail-if-exceeded: true
```
